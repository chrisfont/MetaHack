Calendar Thoughts
=================

- The world is one in which the moon is physically smaller but much closer to the planet, completing a revolution approximately once every 18.2 days. Originally the 20 months were irregular and matched the moon phases; however, in (some date), Empress (some lady) decreed that the month lengths would be standardized, and the remaining days collected at the start of the year as a grand holiday celebration period.

- 20 months of 18 days each = 360 days
    - Each month is composed of 3 hexidia of 6 days each

- One 5 or 6 day period at the start of the year as an extended holiday ("feriatum magnam", grand holiday)

- 1st day of Year 1000 is equivalent to May 3rd, 1979, because why not, I built the damned world

- Dates are represented as "Year: Month H.D" in long form 
    + For example, "1022: Ignis 2.3" is the 3rd day of the 2nd hexidium of the month of Ignis, in the year 1022
- In short form, dates are "Year:MM.H.D"
    + The date above would be "1022:06.2.3"
    + The leading zero is customary when month numbers are used
- The grand festival has a special representation:
    + The long form is "Year: Festival D" where D is the festival day
    + The short form is "Year:F.D" where D is the festival day
