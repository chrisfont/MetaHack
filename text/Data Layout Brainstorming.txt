New ideas for laying out data in the system

/
/categories	- Default (intrinsic) values for all entity categories in the system
/categories/COMPONENTNAME - Data for each individual component
/categories/COMPONENTNAME/TYPENAME
/categories/COMPONENTNAME/TYPENAME/* - Values related to that component

/entities - Values for individual entities in the system
/entities/COMPONENTNAME
/entities/COMPONENTNAME/ENTITYID
/entities/COMPONENTNAME/ENTITYID/*

/global - Global game state information
/global/clock - Game clock, in milliseconds
/global/player - ID of the player

Notes on "mix": A liquid system might automatically take care of mixing ingredients when both are on the same square. 
                Will have to investigate further.
