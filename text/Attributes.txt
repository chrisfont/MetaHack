Info regarding attributes in the code (eventually in its own XML file, maybe):

- Name
- Description
- Maximum amount possible

* Entities have all attributes. Destructable Things (and maybe even MapTiles) have HP.
* XP is not an attribute in the same manner as the other attributes.
* Neither are food/drink timeouts. Those will probably go into "counters".
* Max HP will increase on each level up, by an amount determined by vitality.

* Attribute starting amounts are stored in XML files for different Things, expressed as ranges.

	* A range is expressed as "X to Y" in the XML file. By default, a number will be chosen from the range using a normal distribution. However, a uniform distribution can be chosen by appending "uniform" (or just "uni" or "u") after the range.

Non-Attribute Variables
=======================
    - XP
	- Level
		- Not actually saved anywhere but is derived from XP
    - HP
    - Max HP

Counters
========
	- Decrement down to zero
	- Named "counter_XXXXX" where XXXXX is the counter name
	- busy counter
    - food timeout
    - drink timeout
    - sleep timeout
    - blind timeout
    - deaf timeout
    - drunk timeout
    - confused timeout
    - paralyzed timeout

Proficiencies
=============
	- Range from 0 (unskilled) to 4 (expert)	
	- Named "proficiency_XXXXX" where XXXXX is the weapon category
	- Affects damage done with a weapon
	- Affects chance of landing a hit
	- Affects chance of landing a critical hit
	- Wielding an item that isn't technically a weapon always equates to a proficiency of 0

Attack Procedure
================
	1) Determine if you were accurate enough to hit.
		- For a WIELDED weapon:
			- Proficiency of 0 = 50% chance of hitting
			- Proficiency of 4 = 90% chance of hitting
			- Accuracy Rating = (50 + (Proficiency * 10)) * Luck Factor = (42.5 to 103.5)
		- For a THROWN or FIRED weapon:
			- Proficiency of 0 = 10% chance of hitting
			- Proficiency of 4 = 90% chance of hitting
			- Accuracy Rating = (10 + (Proficiency * 20)) * Luck Factor = (8.5 to 103.5)
		- You hit if RAND(0, 100) is less than your accuracy rating.
        
	2) Determine if the enemy was quick enough to dodge/parry.
		- For a WIELDED weapon:
			- ((AGI * VIG) / 10) * Luck Factor = Dodge Rating (0 to 103.5)
		- For a THROWN weapon:
			- ((AGI * VIG) / 15) * Luck Factor = Dodge Rating (0 to 69)
		- For a FIRED weapon:
			- ((AGI * VIG) / 30) * Luck Factor = Dodge Rating (0 to 34.5)
		- You dodge if RAND(0, 100) is less than your dodge rating.

	3) Determine if the enemy's armor deflected the hit.
		- Calculated by the individual Lua script for the armor.
		- May be affected by the type of damage done (piercing, cutting, etc.)
	
	4) Determine the damage you did.
		- Calculated by the individual Lua script for the weapon.
		- May be multiplied by an attribute factor for certain weapons, e.g. large weapons do more damage with higher STR.
	
	5) Determine the damage deflected by the enemy's armor.
		- Calculated by the individual Lua script for the armor.
		- May be affected by the type of damage done (piercing, cutting, etc.)
    
Attributes
==========
	- Range from 0 to 30
	- Named "attribute_XXXXX" where XXXXX is the attribute name
    - STR - Strength
        - affects how much you can carry
        - typically affects damage done with large and/or blunt force weapons
    - VIG - Vigilance
        - affects identification of secret passages
		- affects picking up on sounds, smells, catching distant glimpses of things, etc.
		- affect dodge/parry (due to being able to anticipate an attack)
    - END - Endurance
        - affects how long you can go without food/water/sleep

        - affects reflexes: action start speed, dodge ability
		- A sessile creature has AGI of 0
    - LUC - Luck
        - affects "random" chance events
		- "Luck Factor" = (1 + ((LUC - 15) / 100)) = 0.85 to 1.15
    - VIT - Vitality
        - affects poison immunity, Max HP gained per level
    - AUR - Aura
        - affects potency of magicule usage, defense against effects

Experience levels
=================
Experience needed to gain a level = ROUND((1.2 ^ current level), 0) * 15
