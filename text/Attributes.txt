Info regarding attributes in the code (eventually in its own XML file, maybe):

- Name
- Description
- Maximum amount possible

* Entities have all attributes. Destructable Things (and maybe even MapTiles) have HP.
* XP is not an attribute in the same manner as the other attributes.
* Neither are food/drink timeouts. Those will probably go into "counters".
* Max HP will increase on each level up, by an amount determined by vitality.

* Attribute starting amounts are stored in XML files for different Things, expressed as ranges.

	* A range is expressed as "X to Y" in the XML file. By default, a number will be chosen from the range using a normal distribution. However, a uniform distribution can be chosen by appending "uniform" (or just "uni" or "u") after the range.

Non-Attribute Variables
=======================
    - XP
	- Level
		- Not actually saved anywhere but is derived from XP
    - HP
    - Max HP

Counters
========
	- Decrement down to zero
	- Named "counter_XXXXX" where XXXXX is the counter name
	- busy counter
    - food timeout
    - drink timeout
    - sleep timeout
    - blind timeout
    - deaf timeout
    - drunk timeout
    - confused timeout
    - paralyzed timeout

Proficiencies
=============
	- Range from 0 (unskilled) to 10 (expert)
	- Named "proficiency_XXXXX" where XXXXX is the weapon category
	- Affects damage done with a weapon
	- Affects chance of landing a hit
	- Affects chance of landing a critical hit
	- Wielding an item that isn't technically a weapon always equates to a proficiency of 0

Weapon Categories
=================
    - First part is "stabbing", "cutting", "striking", etc. as seen in WeaponXXX.lua Thing classes.
    - Second part is "small"/"large"/"huge" as determined by the Thing's physical mass.
    - e.g. a greatsword would be classified as "cutting_huge".

Combat
======
    - First, figure out how accurate your attack was.
        - ((PRE + 2) * (weapon proficiency + 2)) + (LUC - 15) = accuracy rating (-11 to 399)
        - A "hit" is scored if rand(0, 400) is below your accuracy rating
        
    - Second, figure out if the enemy parries/dodges your attack.
        - (AGI * VIG) + (LUC - 15) = dodge rating (-15 to 915)
        - A dodge is successful if rand(0, 1000) is below your accuracy rating
        - This isn't quite right; figure it out later.
        
    - Third, figure out the damage done by the attack.
