GSL NOTE -- this is a bit out of date as I have decided Attributes will go from 0 to 31.  Keeping this though for the experience level info.

Info regarding attributes in the code (eventually in its own XML file, maybe):

- Name
- Description
- Maximum amount possible

* Entities have all attributes. Destructable Things (and maybe even MapTiles) have HP.
* XP is not an attribute in the same manner as the other attributes.
* Neither are food/drink timeouts. Those will probably go into "counters".
* Max HP will increase on each level up, by an amount determined by vitality.

* Attribute starting amounts are stored in XML files for different Things, expressed as ranges.

	* A range is expressed as "X to Y" in the XML file. By default, a number will be chosen from the range using a normal distribution. However, a uniform distribution can be chosen by appending "uniform" (or just "uni" or "u") after the range.
