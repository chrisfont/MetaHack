User Interface Notes
===============================================================================

Reorient more towards the mouse instead of the keyboard

Message log remains at the top of the screen
Status area at the bottom of the screen
"Things Here" on the left side of the screen
Map view on the right side of the screen

InventoryView
- "Things Here" is an example of an InventoryView that remains static on the screen and is always pointing at the map tile the player is occupying.
- InventoryView can be one of the following layouts:
    + Grid: Grid of icons representing items. Hover over item to have its description show in the status bar
    + List: List of icons followed by descriptions. Hovering still shows description in status bar
- Scroll bar or scroll wheel can be used to scroll up/down

ItemView
- Left-clicking on any item performs the "default" action for the item. For a container (or the player), this action is "view", which is a free action that opens a new window (see below).
- Right-clicking (or long-pressing) on any item icon shows an ActionWheel. Might also allow a click+hold action to bring up the ActionWheel, with a release on an action icon closing it.

MapView
- Hovering over anything on the grid shows its name in the status bar, and an icon showing the "default" action taken by the left mouse button.
- Each square on the grid is a MapTileView.

MapTileView
- Similar to an ItemView, but with a few modifications.
    + If the tile is not directly adjacent to the player, the default action is "view"; however, no actions can be performed on the items shown in the window.
    + If the tile *is* adjacent to the player, the default action will depend on the primary (largest) occupant of the tile, e.g.:
        * A blank wall: "view".
        * A wall with writing on it: "read".
        * A closed door: "open".
        * An open door, or any other passable object: "move".

Actions::View (free action)
- Brings up a new window with its own InventoryView.
    + New window is centered around the click location if possible; at the least the click location should be contained inside the new window
    + Clicking outside this new window automatically closes it, to keep clutter down.
    + Might allow a "pin" control to keep the window open if desired.

ActionWheelView
- Expands out from the item summoning it
- Contains icons representing all the actions that can be performed on/with this item by the player
- Might allow for multiple layers of items, to support larger numbers of them
- Contains an "X" action icon to close the wheel
- Also closes if anywhere outside the wheel is clicked
- May be rotatable by left/right arrow keys, layers switched by up/down arrow keys, action picked by Enter key, and closed by Esc key.
