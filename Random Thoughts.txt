Random MetaHack Thoughts
========================

** Size Classes

Everything in the game has a size class, which determines how large it is on the map and what it can share a location with:

Size		Map		Area	
=======		=======	=======	
Small		1x1		0		
Medium		1x1		1
Large		3x3		9 		
Huge		5x5		25		
Gigantic	7x7		49	
Colossal	9x9		81 

A map tile has an area of 1, and can hold 1 unit. When an object exists on a map, its area is spread out across the tiles it occupies, so each tile holds 1 unit of the object.

This results in a mechanic very different from other roguelikes, since you can't walk over a medium object (like the corpse of a medium-sized monster) to pick it up.  Instead, you'd pick it up when you're adjacent to it.  Likewise, you can conceivably hide behind corpses from monsters (although a gigantic monster might very well pick up a corpse and hurl it at you!).

Objects sized medium and higher block both vision and projectiles.

An inventory can only hold objects equal to or smaller than the size of the object the inventory belongs to, unless it is somehow magical (such as a bag of holding).  Thus, a medium inventory can hold objects of size medium, small, or tiny.  Of course, total carrying capacity is limited by weight in the end.

For comparison, medium is about large dog to human sized.

** Other **

* "wand of mundanity" -- reverts things to totally mundane versions, e.g. totally non-supernatural and non-magical.  Wands become wands of nothing, armor with special abilities becomes plain old armor, a werewolf becomes a plain old wolf, a floating eye becomes a giant eye corpse laying on the ground, et cetera.  Obviously some things would need resistance to this or you'd have one hell of an overpowered item.

* No "wand of cancellation" then, or cancellation in general as it applies to NetHack.  There would be a "wand of antimagic" perhaps that would drain MP, remove enchantments, etc.  This would work on monsters that use magical attacks since it would reduce their MP to zero, but would not necessarily stop the attacks completely (since the monster would eventually regain MP over time).

* Fictional things from all sorts of universes can exist here, as the idea of MetaHack is that the walls between fiction and non-fiction are breaking down.

* Rings can be worn on ring fingers, other fingers, or toes, but they have progressively weaker effects based on where they are worn.

* I decree here and now that you won't be able to kill yourself by kicking something.  Your leg will become too sore to kick before that happens, and kicking something will never reduce your HP below 1.  Dying by kicking something, while a funny YASD, is rather stupid.

* "X gave up in the face of certain death" -- genocide base type while polymorphed

* Polymorphing should be handled in the code by some sort of sub-object, since it is reversible.

* No slot "y" in the inventory, for safety's sake.  Although I might invert the Nethack style and do an object-oriented style of interface, where you choose the object first and the action second.

** Spells/items **

* "X of phasing" / "phasing cloak" (see, it's a pun)

* "X of youth" -- revert monsters/items to younger forms.  This might be the same as "X of drain level" though.

* "Scroll of alter life" (replaces "genocide") scroll effects:
      Damned - Doubles encounter rate of an entity, entity always generated hostile
	  Cursed - Generates a number of hostile instances of an entity
	Uncursed - All future generations of an entity will be peaceful, occasionally tame
	 Blessed - Removes all instances of an entity
	  Sacred - Removes all instances of an entire entity class
